# Shortcut Safety

The app avoids interfering with common system and application shortcuts.

## System Shortcuts
- Spotlight search (`Cmd+Space`)
- Mission Control (`Ctrl+Up`, `Ctrl+Down`)
- App Switcher (`Cmd+Tab`)

## Developer Tools
- Common VS Code and Xcode shortcuts have been tested to remain functional.

If a particular combination should be processed, add its key code to the Command/Control whitelist in preferences. Option-modified input can also be bypassed entirely via the menu.
